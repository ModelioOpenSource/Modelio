This capability is provided with\nthe intent of allowing such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products.\nInformation about packaging Installable Software is available at\nhttp\://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html ("Specification").\n\nYou may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install Installable Software.\nYou shall be responsible for enabling the applicable license agreements relating to the\nInstallable Software to be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology\nin accordance with the Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and\nmaking it available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your\nagreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the following\:\n\n\t1. A series of actions may occur ("Provisioning Process") in which a user may execute\n\t   the Provisioning Technology on a machine ("Target Machine") with the intent of installing,\n\t   extending or updating the functionality of an Eclipse-based product.\n\t2. During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third party\n\t   Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to the Target Machine.\n\t3. Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and conditions that\n\t   govern the use of the Installable Software ("Installable Software Agreement") and such\n\t   Installable Software Agreement shall be accessed from the Target Machine in accordance\n\t   with the Specification. Such Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the\n\t   terms and conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance by\n\t   the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable Software Agreement. Upon such\n\t   indication of agreement by the user, the provisioning Technology will complete installation\n\t   of the Installable Software.\n\nCryptography\n\nContent may contain encryption software.
