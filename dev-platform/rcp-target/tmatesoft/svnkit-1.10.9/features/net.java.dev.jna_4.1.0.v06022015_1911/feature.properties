description=JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries \
(DLLs on Windows) without writing anything but Java code - no JNI \
or native code is required. This functionality is comparable \
to Windows&apos; Platform/Invoke and Python&apos;s ctypes. \
Access is dynamic at runtime without code generation.
