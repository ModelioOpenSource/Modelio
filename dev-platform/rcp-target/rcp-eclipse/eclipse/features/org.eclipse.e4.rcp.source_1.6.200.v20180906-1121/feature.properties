Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a\ndirectory named "features". Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may\ncontain a list of the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or\nFragments associated with that Feature.\n-   Features may also include other Features ("Included Features"). Within a\nFeature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and\nversion numbers of Included Features.\n\nThe terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in\nfiles named "about.html" ("Abouts"). The terms and conditions governing Features\nand Included Features should be contained in files named "license.html"\n("Feature Licenses"). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any\ndirectory of a Download or Module including, but not limited to the following\nlocations\:\n\n-   The top-level (root) directory\n-   Plug-in and Fragment directories\n-   Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs\n-   Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins\n-   Feature directories\n\nNote\: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using\nthe Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you must agree to a license\n("Feature Update License") during the installation process. If the Feature\ncontains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you\nwith the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform you\nwhere you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license"\nproperty of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature. Such\nAbouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and\nconditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of\nthe associated Content in that directory.\n\nTHE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO THE EPL\nOR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

Information\nabout packaging Installable Software is available at\nhttp\://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html ("Specification").\n\nYou may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install\nInstallable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the applicable\nlicense agreements relating to the Installable Software to be presented to, and\naccepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology in accordance with the\nSpecification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making it\navailable in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your\nagreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the\nfollowing\:\n\n1.  A series of actions may occur ("Provisioning Process") in which a user may\nexecute the Provisioning Technology on a machine ("Target Machine") with the\nintent of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an\nEclipse-based product.\n2.  During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third\nparty Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to\nthe Target Machine.\n3.  Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and\nconditions that govern the use of the Installable Software ("Installable\nSoftware Agreement") and such Installable Software Agreement shall be\naccessed from the Target Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such\nInstallable Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and\nconditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance\nby the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable\nSoftware Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the\nprovisioning Technology will complete installation of the\nInstallable Software.\n\nCryptography\n\nContent may contain encryption software.
