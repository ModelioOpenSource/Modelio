/**
 * Interface for complex graphic creation interaction in a diagram. <br>
 * <br>
 * The interaction is started when the user clicks on the button in the diagram palette. Once the interaction is started
 * the user can use the mouse to create a new graphic multi link in the diagram.<br>
 * The {@link #acceptFirstElement(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic) acceptFirstElement} method is called to know if
 * the element flown over by the mouse is valid to be the first element of the interaction. If it is not valid as first
 * element, then the {@link #acceptLastElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic) acceptLastElement} method is
 * called to know if the element flown over by the mouse is valid as last element of the interaction (in which case the
 * interaction is done with a single click, as is the case for IBoxCommand for example). <br>
 * If the element is valid as first element the interaction moves on to the next step. The
 * {@link #acceptAdditionalElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic) acceptAdditionalElement} method is
 * called to know if the element flown over by the mouse can be added to the current interaction. If it is not valid to
 * be added to the current interaction, then the {@link #acceptLastElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic)
 * acceptLastElement} method is called to know if the element flown over by the mouse is valid as last element of the
 * interaction.<br>
 * When the user clicks on an element for which the
 * {@link #acceptAdditionalElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic) acceptAdditionalElement} method doesn't
 * accept the element to be added to the interaction but the
 * {@link #acceptLastElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic) acceptLastElement} method accepts the element
 * as last element of the interaction, the
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, List, List, List, Rectangle) actionPerformed} method is
 * called. <br>
 * <br>
 * The {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, List, List, List, Rectangle) actionPerformed} method
 * is in charge of creating the elements in the model and of unmasking them in the diagram.
 * 
 * This interface is intended to be implemented by MDA Components in order to add commands in a diagram palette.
