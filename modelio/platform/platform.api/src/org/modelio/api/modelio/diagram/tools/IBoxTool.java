/**
 * Interface for creating graphic boxes in a diagram.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In a diagram, graphic boxes are graphic objects that display diagram nodes. For example Packages and Classes are
 * graphic boxes. <code>IBoxCommand</code> is the interface that drives the interaction of creating a box
 * <p>
 * 
 * The interaction is started when the user clicks on the button in the diagram palette. Once the interaction is started
 * the user can use the mouse to create a new graphic box in the diagram. The
 * {@link #acceptElement(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic) acceptElement} method is called to know if the element flown
 * over by the mouse is valid for the command. If it is not valid the user cannot finish the interaction. If the element
 * is valid the user can terminates the interaction by either clicking or by pressing the left mouse button doing a drag
 * and drop and releasing the mouse button. Once this is done the
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, Rectangle) actionPerformed} is called.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, Rectangle) actionPerformed} is in charge of creating the
 * model element in the model and of unmasking the element in the diagram.
 * 
 * This interface is intended to be implemented by MDA Components in order to add commands in a diagram palette.
