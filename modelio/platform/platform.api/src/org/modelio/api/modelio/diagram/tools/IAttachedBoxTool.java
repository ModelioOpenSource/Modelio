/**
 * Interface for creating graphic attached boxes in a diagram.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In a diagram, graphic boxes attached are graphic objects that display diagram nodes linked to another diagram
 * element. For example Notes and Constraints are graphic attached boxes.
 * <code>IAttachedBoxCommand</code> is the interface that drives the interaction of creating a box attached to another
 * diagram element
 * <p>
 * 
 * The interaction is started when the user clicks on the button in the diagram palette. Once the interaction is started
 * the user can use the mouse to create a new graphic attached box in the diagram. The
 * {@link #acceptElement(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic) acceptElement} method is called to know if the element
 * flown over by the mouse is valid for the command. If it is not valid the user cannot finish the interaction. If the
 * element is valid the user can terminates the interaction.<br>
 * If the user click in the diagram background
 * {@link #actionPerformedInDiagram(IDiagramHandle, Rectangle) actionPerformedInDiagram} is called.<br>
 * If the user click on the element to attach then in the diagram background
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, LinkRouterKind, ILinkPath, Point)
 * actionPerformed} is called.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, LinkRouterKind, ILinkPath, Point)
 * actionPerformed} and {@link #actionPerformedInDiagram(IDiagramHandle, Rectangle)
 * actionPerformedInDiagram} methods are in charge of creating the model element in the model and of unmasking the
 * element in the diagram.
 * 
 * This interface is intended to be implemented by MDA Components in order to add commands in a diagram palette.
