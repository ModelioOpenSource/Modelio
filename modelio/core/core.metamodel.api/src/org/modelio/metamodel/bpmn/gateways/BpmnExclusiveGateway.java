 * BpmnExclusiveGateway v0.0.9054

 * A diverging Exclusive Gateway (Decision) is used to create alternative paths within a Process flow. This is basically the ?diversion point in the road? for a Process. For a given instance of the Process, only one of the paths can be taken.
 * A Decision can be thought of as a question that is asked at a particular point in the Process. The question has a defined set of alternative answers. Each question is associated with a condition Expression that is associated with a Gateway?s outgoing Sequence Flow.
