 * BpmnCompensateEventDefinition v0.0.9054

 * 
 * Compensation Events are used in the context of triggering or handling compensation. There are four (4) variations: a Start Event, both a catch and throw Intermediate Event, and an End Event.
 * - The Compensation Start Event MAY NOT be used for a top-level Process.
 * - The Compensation Start Event MAY be used for an Event Sub-Process.
 * - The catch Compensation Intermediate Event MUST only be attached to the boundary of an Activity and, thus, MAY NOT be used in normal flow.
 * - The throw Compensation Intermediate Event MAY be used in normal flow.
 * - The Compensation End Event MAY be used within any Sub-Process or Process.
