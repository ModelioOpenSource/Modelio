 * <p>A Process describes a sequence or flow of Activities in an organization with the objective of carrying out work.</p><p>In BPMN a Process is depicted as a graph of Flow Elements, which are a set of Activities, Events, Gateways, and Sequence Flow that define finite execution semantics.</p><p>Processes may be defined at any level from enterprise-wide Processes to Processes performed by a single person. Low-level Processes may be grouped together to achieve a common business goal.</p><p>Note that BPMN uses the term Process specifically to mean a set of flow elements. It uses the terms Collaboration and Choreography when modeling the interaction between</p><p>Processes Ownership: In Modelio, a&nbsp;Process is a Behavior so&nbsp;belongs to any UML element that can contain a Behavior. BPMN Process will usually be created in UML Packages, but may also be found to a Class or an Operation.</p>
