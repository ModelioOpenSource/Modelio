 * 
 * <p>The Group object is an Artifact that provides a visual mechanism to group elements of a diagram informally. The grouping is tied to the Category supporting element . That is, a Group is a visual depiction of a single Category. The graphical elements within the Group will be assigned the Category of the Group. (Note: Categories can be highlighted through other mechanisms, such as color, as defined by a modeler or a modeling tool). Categories, which have user-defined semantics, can be used for documentation or analysis purposes.</p><p>For example, FlowElements can be categorized has being customer oriented vs. support oriented.</p><p>Groups are one way in which Categories of objects can be visually displayed on the diagram. That is, a Group is a visual depiction of a single Category. The graphical elements within the Group will be assigned the Category of the Group. The Category name appears on the diagram as the Group label. (Note:&nbsp;Categories can be highlighted through other mechanisms, such as color, as defined by a modeler or a modeling tool). A single Category can be used for multiple Groups in a diagram.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
