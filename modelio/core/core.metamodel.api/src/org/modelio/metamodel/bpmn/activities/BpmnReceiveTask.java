/**
 * BpmnReceiveTask v0.0.9054
 * 
 * 
 * A Receive Task is a simple Task that is designed to wait for a Message to arrive from an external Participant (relative to the Process). Once the Message has been received, the Task is completed.
 * The actual Participant from which the Message is received can be identified by connecting the Receive Task to a Participant using a Message Flow within the definitional Collaboration of the Process.
 * 
 * A Receive Task is often used to start a Process. In a sense, the Process is bootstrapped by the receipt of the Message. In order for the Task to Instantiate the Process it must meet one of the following conditions:
 * - The Process does not have a Start Event and the Receive Task has no incoming Sequence Flow.
 * - The incoming Sequence Flow for the Receive Task has a source of a Start Event.
 * - Note that no other incoming Sequence Flow are allowed for that Receive Task (in particular, a loop
 * connection from a downstream object).
 *
