 * BpmnAssociation v0.0.9054

 * An Association is used to associate information and Artifacts with Flow Objects. Text and graphical non-Flow Objects can be associated with the Flow Objects and Flow. An Association is also used to show the Activity used for
 * compensation. 
 * 
 * Within Modelio, Text Annotation is implemented by Notes: association is thus not used to connect Notes to Model elements.
