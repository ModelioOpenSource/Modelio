/**
 * ActivityAction v0.0.9054
 * 
 * 
 * The execution of an action represents some transformation or processing in the modeled system, be it a computer system or otherwise.
 * 
 * An action may have sets of incoming and outgoing activity edges that specify control flow and data flow to and from other nodes. An action will not begin execution until all of its input conditions are satisfied. The completion of the execution of an action may enable the execution of a set of successor nodes and actions that take their inputs from the outputs of the action.
 * 
 * Action can have pre- and post-conditions (using constraints).
