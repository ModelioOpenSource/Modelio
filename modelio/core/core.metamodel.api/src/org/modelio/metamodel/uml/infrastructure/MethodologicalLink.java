/**
 * MethodologicalLink v2.1.01
 * 
 * 
 * A methodological link allows drawing semantic relationships between elements originating from the same or different metamodels.
 * 
 * They allow building up methodologies such as progressive model refinements, inter models traceability, impact analysis, dependency graphes...
 * 
 * The semantic of a methodological link is defined by its stereotype. A MethodLink without stereotype has no meaning and is not allowed by Modelio.
 * 
 * The module bringing the stereotype defines:
 * - the semantic of the methodological link
 * - the allowed sources and targets of the link
