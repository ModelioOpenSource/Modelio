 * AcceptChangeEventAction v0.0.9054

 * A change event occurs when the Boolean-valued expression becomes true. For example, as a result of a change in the value held in a slot corresponding to an attribute, or a change in the value referenced by a link corresponding to an association. 
 * 
 * A change event is raised implicitly and is not the result of an explicit action. 
 * 
 * Each time the value of the change expression changes from false to true, the change event action is triggered.
