/**
 * Dependency v0.0.9054
 * 
 * 
 * <p>In the metamodel, a Dependency is a directed relationship from a client to a supplier, stating that the client is dependent on the supplier (in other words, the client element requires the presence and knowledge of the supplier element).</p><p>Dependencies are widely used inside Modelio to manage traceability. Any ModelElement can be traced to another ModelElement using this association.</p><p>In Modelio, a Dependency can only have one client and one supplier.</p><p>In Modelio, in order to comply with UML 2.0, the roles are swapped and renamed. The correspondence from UML 2.0 is now as follows:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Dependency.client = Dependency.Impacted;</li>
 * 	<li>Dependency.supplier = Dependency.DependsOn;</li>
 * 	<li>Element.supplierDependency = ModelElement.ImpactedDependency;</li>
 * 	<li>Element.clientDependency = ModelElement.DependsOnDependency.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>A Dependency now belongs to the impacted element (the client in UML 2.0).</p>
