/**
 * Connector v0.0.9054
 * 
 * 
 * A Connector specifies a Link that enables communication between two or more instances. This Link represents the possibility of the instances being able to communicate, because their identities are known by virtue of being passed as parameters, held in variables or slots, or because the communicating instances are the same instance. The Link may be realized by something as simple as a pointer or by something as complex as a network connection. 
 * 
 * In contrast to Associations, which specify Links between any instance of the associated Classifiers, Connectors specify Links between instances playing the connected parts only.
 * 
 * In Modelio, a Connector is a Link and can be bound to another element.
