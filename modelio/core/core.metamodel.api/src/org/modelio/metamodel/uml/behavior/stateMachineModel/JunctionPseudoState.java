/**
 * JunctionPseudoState v0.0.9054
 * 
 * 
 * Junction vertices are semantic-free vertices that are used to chain together multiple transitions. They are used to construct compound transition paths between states. For example, a junction can be used to converge multiple incoming transitions into a single outgoing transition representing a shared transition path (this is known as a merge). 
 * 
 * Conversely, they can be used to split an incoming transition into multiple outgoing transition segments with different guard conditions. This realizes a static conditional branch. 
 * (In the latter case, outgoing transitions whose guard conditions evaluate to false are disabled. 
 * A predefined guard denoted "else" may be defined for at most one outgoing transition. This transition is enabled if all the guards labeling the other transitions are false.) 
 * Static conditional branches are distinct from dynamic conditional branches that are realized by choice vertices (described below).
 *
