/**
 * StructuredActivityNode v0.0.9054
 * 
 * 
 * A structured activity node represents a structured portion of the activity that is not shared with any other structured node, except for nesting. It may have control edges connected to it and pins. 
 * The execution of any embedded actions may not begin until the structured activity node has received its object and control tokens. The availability of output tokens from the structured activity node does not occur until all embedded actions have completed execution.
 * 
 * In order to avoid race conditions or other concurrency-related  problems, it is sometimes necessary to isolate the effects of a group of actions from the effects of actions outside the group. This may be indicated by setting the mustIsolate attribute to true on a structured activity node. In this case, any object used by an action within the node cannot be accessed by any action outside the node until the structured activity node as a whole completes.
