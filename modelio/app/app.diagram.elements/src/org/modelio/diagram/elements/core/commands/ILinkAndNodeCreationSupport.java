 * This interface is intended to be implemented by commands that create nodes.
 * A node creation command implementing <code>ILinkAndNodeCreationSupport</code> shall provide the GmNodeModel of the node it creates.
 * Such commands can therefore be used as action provider for "create link and node" behavior.<p/>
 * See {@link AbstractCreateLinkChooseNodeEditPolicy} and {@link CreateLinkAndNodeCommand} for further explanations.<br/>
 * See {@link DefaultCreateElementCommand} for an implementation example.
