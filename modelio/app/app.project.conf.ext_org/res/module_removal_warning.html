<p><h3 style="color:#2b5775">You are about to remove a module from the project.</h3>
<h4 style="color:#3b749f">This operation has the following consequences:</h4>
<ul>
<li>All annotations (stereotypes, tagged values, notes, etc.) brought by this module will be deleted.
<li>All the module's commands and functionalities won't be available anymore.</li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#bb0000">Warning: this operation can't be undone, meaning even reinstalling the module won't restore the annotations.</span>         
</p>
<p>
N.B. Some read-only elements can use the module's annotations (stereotypes, tagged values, notes, etc.).<br/>
The read-only libraries using the module's annotations have to be removed from the project prior to removing the module itself.<br/>
To do so, use the 'Configuration\Libraries...' command.
