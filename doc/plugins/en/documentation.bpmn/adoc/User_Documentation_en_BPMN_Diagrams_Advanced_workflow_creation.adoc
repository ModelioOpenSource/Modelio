= Advanced workflow creation

== Smart sequence flow tool


=== Link mode

The _BpmnSequenceFlow_ creation tool has the standard link creation behavior when used between two workflow elements. For example, from a task to another, creation is direct.


=== Element mode

When used between an element and the diagram's background or a _BpmnLane_, a popup opens to choose which element is to be created ( _BpmnTask_, _BpmnEvent_...) as the new link's target.

For example : from a task, right clicking on the diagram's bottom allows to create a task in the diagram, linked to the original task through a _BpmnSequenceFlow_.

== Inserting workflow nodes

Creating a workflow element ( _BpmnTask_, _BpmnGateway_...) on a _BpmnSequenceFlow_ *F* inserts the node in the sequence :

* a _BpmnSequenceFlow_ is created between *F* 's source and the new element;
* another _BpmnSequenceFlow_ is created between the new element and *F* 's target.

== Inserting Data Object nodes

Creating a _BpmnDataObject_ on a _BpmnSequenceFlow_ *F* effectivly creates a model corresponding to a data transmission through the flow:

* a _BpmnDataAssociation_ is created between *F* 's source and the new _BpmnDataObject_;
* another _BpmnDataAssociation_ is created between the new _BpmnDataObject_ and *F* 's target;
* a _BpmnSequenceFlowDataAssociation_ is created between the _BpmnDataObject_ and *F*.

== Creating Throw/Catch Link Event pairs

Creating a _BpmnIntermediateCatchEvent_ or a _BpmnIntermediateThrowEvent_ on a _BpmnSequenceFlow_ *F* inserts a sequence break in the workflow:

* a _BpmnSequenceFlow_ is created from *F* 's source to a _BpmnIntermediateThrowEvent ;_
* a _BpmnSequenceFlow_ is created from a _BpmnIntermediateCatchEvent_ to *F's target* _;_
* both _BpmnIntermediateCatchEvent andBpmnIntermediateThrowEvent_ are linked in the model itself.

N.B. : when Throw/Catch events are linked, selecting one of them in a diagram displays a link to the other.
