= Importing a model in BPMN format


== Introduction

The Modelio BPMN Import service is used to import a BPMN model form a *.bpmn file. It also allows to update an existing and previously imported BPMN model based on an updated *.bpmn file.

During the import process, you can choose to keep the ID of the elements declared in the imported file, or to generate new Modelio ID. If you choose to keep the original elements id, you must keep in mind that these ID must be unique. Otherwise, you will be exposed to unexpected errors during the import process.
