===== Summary

A _MessageFlow_ cannot have a Gateway as its source or target.




===== Details

_Gateways_ are control nodes that control the flow of a sequence. Only _SequenceFlows_ should connect them.




===== Tips

If you have a _MessageFlow_ connecting a _Gateway_, you should change it to a _SequenceFlow_ instead.
