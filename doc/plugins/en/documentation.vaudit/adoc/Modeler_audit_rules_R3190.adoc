===== Summary

A _DataAssociation_ cannot target a _DataInput_ nor have a _DataOutput_ as its source.




===== Details

_DataInputs_ are meant to send data while _DataOutputs_ are meant to receive data.




===== Tips

If you have outgoing data on a _DataOutput_ or incoming data on a _DataInput_, you are doing something wrong and you should change your _DataAssociation_ source or target.
