===== Summary

ObjectFlows cannot be multi-receive and multi-cast at the same time.




===== Details

_UML Specification_: Multi-casting and multi-receiving are used in conjunction with partitions to model flows between behaviours that are the responsibility of objects determined by a publish and subscribe facility.




===== Tips

When you get a R1320 warning on an ObjectFlow, verify that the multi-receive and multi-cast properties are not both set to true.
