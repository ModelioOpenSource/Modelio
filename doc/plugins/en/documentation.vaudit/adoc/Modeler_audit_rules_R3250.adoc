===== Summary

_Processes_ and _SubProcesses_ should have at least one _StartEvent_ and one _EndEvent_.




===== Details

_Processes_ and _SubProcesses_ represent an independent process, and a process is represented with a single sequence, starting with a _StartEvent_, and ending with an _EndEvent_.




===== Tips

If you have a sequence that does not start with a _StartEvent_ and end with an _EndEvent_, you should add them to your sequence to make it right.
