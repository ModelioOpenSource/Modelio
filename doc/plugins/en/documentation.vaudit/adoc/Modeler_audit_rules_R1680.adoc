===== Summary

For a _Call_-type _Event_, the 'Called operation' field must be defined, whereas the 'Instanciated signal' must be empty.




===== Details

An _Event_ is the specification of a specific occurrence at a specific point in space and time.

A _Call_-type _Event_ is meant to call an operation, and cannot instantiate a _Signal_ at the same time.




===== Tips

Add a reference to an _Operation_, if the _Event_ doesn't have one.

An _Event_ instantiating a _Signal_ should be a _Signal_-type _Event_.
