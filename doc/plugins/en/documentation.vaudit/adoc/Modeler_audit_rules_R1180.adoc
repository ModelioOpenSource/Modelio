===== Summary

A _ControlFlow_ cannot have an _ObjectNode_ at one of its ends.




===== Details

All edges coming into or going out of _ObjectNodes_ must be _ObjectFlows_.

However, _ObjectNodes_ can be marked as "Control type", in which case they can have _ControlFlows_ going in or out.




===== Tips

The "Control type" property of an _ObjectNode_ can be modified through the "Element" view when said _ObjectNode_ is selected.
