===== Summary

An ObjectFlow with a constant weight cannot target an ObjectNode which has an

upper bound less than the weight.




===== Details

_UML constraint_: An edge with constant weight may not target an object node, or lead to an object node downstream with no intervening actions, that has an upper bound less than the weight.




===== Tips

When you get a R1310 warning on an ObjectFlow, verify that all the downstream ObjectNodes have an upper bound value superior to its weight.
