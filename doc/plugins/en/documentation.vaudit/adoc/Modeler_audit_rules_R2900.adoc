===== Summary

An _extension relationship_ must reference at least one _Extension Point_.




===== Details

An _Extension Point_ is a feature of a _Use Case_ that identifies a point where the behaviour of a Use Case can be augmented with elements of another (extending) _Use Case_. Therefore, an _extension relationship_ should reference an _Extension Point_ of the _Use Case_ it extends.




===== Tips

Add an _Extension Point_ to the _Use Case_ you want to extend if none already exist, and/or reference that _Extension Point_ in the _extension relationship_ properties.
