===== Summary

A target _Pin_ can only be owned by a _CallOperationAction_ or a _SendSignalAction_.




===== Details

The target _Pin_ is an _InputPin_ that represents the target object to which the request or signal is sent. Only _CallOperationActions_ or _SendSignalActions_ can own such a _Pin_.




===== Tips

This rule is triggered when the "_Self"_ property of a _Pin_ is checked and the owner of the _Pin_ in question is neither a _CallOperationAction_ nor a _SendSignalAction_.

This property can be modified through the "Element" view when the _Pin_ is selected.
