===== Summary

If a _Port_ is a behavior _Port_, the _Port_ must be typed either by the _Class_ it belongs to or undefined.




===== Details

Any invocation of a behavioral feature on a behavior _Port_ will be handled by the owning _Classifier_ itself, rather than by any instances that this classifier may contain.




===== Tips

* Change the type of the _Port_ to the owning _Classifier_ or to nothing.
* Change the _Port_ into a classic _Port_.
