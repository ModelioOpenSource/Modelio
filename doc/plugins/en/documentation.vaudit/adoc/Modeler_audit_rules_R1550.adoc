===== Summary

If a _BindableInstance_ has a type and a represented feature, the type of the instance must be compatible with the type of this feature.




===== Details

A part can represent an _Attribute_, an _AssociationEnd_ or a _Port_.

* In the case of an _Attribute_ or a _Port_, the type of the _BindableInstance_ must be the same type as the _Attribute_ or the _Port_.
* If it represents an _AssociationEnd_, it must be the same type as the owner of one of the _Associations's_ other _AssociationEnds_.




===== Tips

Change the type of your instance, or change which model element it represents.
