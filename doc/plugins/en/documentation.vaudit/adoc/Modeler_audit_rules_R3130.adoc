===== Summary

A MessageFlow cannot target an EndEvent or an IntermediateThrowEvent, or have a StartEvent or an IntermediateCatchEvent as its source.




===== Details

A _StartEvent_ begins a sequence and cannot have outgoing message flows. Similarly, an _EndEvent_ ends a sequence and cannot have any incoming message flows.

A _CatchEvent_ node catches messages but cannot send them, while a _ThrowEvent_ sends messages but cannot catch them.




===== Tips

If you have outgoing flows from a _StartEvent_ or incoming flows on an _EndEvent_, you must remove them. If you have incoming message flows on a _ThrowEvent_, you should consider changing them to a _CatchEvent_ instead. Similarly, if you have outgoing message flows from a CatchEvent, you should consider making them _ThrowEvents_ instead.
