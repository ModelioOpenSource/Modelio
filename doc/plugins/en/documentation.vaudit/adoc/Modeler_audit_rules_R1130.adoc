===== Summary

The type or the maximum multiplicity of a pin belonging to a CallOperationAction does not match its matched parameter.




===== Details

_UML constraint_: The type, ordering, and multiplicity of an argument or result pin are derived from the corresponding owned parameter of the operation.

Example:

image::images/Modeler_audit_rules_R1130_modeler_fig_1130.gif[image]

The Project CallOperationAction is invalid because the type of its projectId pin does not match the parameter type it is matched with.




===== Tips

When you get a R1130 error, you can resolve it by doing one of the following:

* Change the type or the maximum multiplicity of one of the concerned parameters.
* Change the type or the maximum multiplicity of one of the concerned pins.
