===== Summary

An _extension relationship_ can only reference _Extension Points_ from its targeted _Use Case_.




===== Details

An _Extension Point_ is a feature of a _Use Case_ that identifies a point where the behavior of a _Use Case_ can be augmented with elements of another (extending) _Use Case_. Therefore, the referenced _Extension Point_ must be part of the extended Use Case, which is the target of the _extension relationship_.




===== Tips

* Choose another _Extension Point_ to reference. This must be part of the extended _Use Case_.
* Otherwise, make the _extension relationship_ target the _Use Case_ containing the referenced _Extension Point_.
