===== Summary

A state machine or a state cannot contain several states with the same name.




===== Details

The name of a state must be unique in the enclosing state machine or state. Showing the same name twice may cause confusion.




===== Tips

Possible solutions to this problem are as follows:

* *Solution 1* +
Rename one of the states that have the same name. This name must be unique in the enclosing state machine or state.
* *Solution 2*
Move one of the states that have the same name to a different enclosing state, which does not already contain a state with that name.
