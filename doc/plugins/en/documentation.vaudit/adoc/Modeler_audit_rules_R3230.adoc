===== Summary

All _SequenceFlows_ leaving an _ExclusiveGateway_ must have a guard, except for the default _SequenceFlow_.




===== Details

An _ExclusiveGateway_ acts as an 'OR', and therefore all the flows leaving from it should have a condition to satisfy in order to get the token, with the exception of the default flow, which gets the token if all conditions have failed.




===== Tips

If you have an _ExclusiveGateway_ with outgoing flows which do not have a guard and which are not the default flow, you should edit the guard property of the flow.
