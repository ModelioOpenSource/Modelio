===== Summary

_InputPins_ of the _SendSignalAction_ do not match the _Signal_'s _Attributes_.




===== Details

_UML constraint_:

* The number and order of _InputPins_ must be the same as the number and order of _Attributes_ in the _Signal_.

Example:

image::images/Modeler_audit_rules_R1380_image001.png[image]

The "StartEvent" _SendSignalAction_ is invalid, because the "location" _Attribute_ of the "StartEvent" _Signal_ it is calling is not matched to one of its _InputPins_.




===== Tips

When you get an R1380 error, verify the following:

* You have the same number of _InputPins_ on the _SendSignalAction_ as the number of _Attributes_ of the _Signal_.
* Each _Attribute_ is represented by one and only one _InputPin_.
