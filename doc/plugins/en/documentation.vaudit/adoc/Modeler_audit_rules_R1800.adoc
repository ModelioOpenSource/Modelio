===== Summary

If a _CombinedFragment_ operator is of type 'opt', 'loop', 'break' or 'neg' there should be only one _InteractionOperand_ in this _CombinedFragment_.




===== Details

The 'opt', 'loop', 'break' and 'neg' operators are defined to work with only one operand.




===== Tips

This rule indicates an inconsistency between the operator and the number of _InteractionOperand_ in the _CombinedFragment_ in question.
