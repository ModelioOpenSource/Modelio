===== Summary

All _Transitions_ leaving a _Fork_ _Vertex_ must target different regions of an orthogonal _State_.




===== Details

Regions of an orthogonal _State_ are concurrent flows, so a _Fork Vertex_ should only have targets in different _Regions_.




===== Tips

If you have a _Fork_ _Vertex_ targeting _States_ in the same _Region_, you should delete one of the _Transitions_ or move some targets into another _Region_.
