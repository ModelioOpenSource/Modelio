===== Summary

The 'Instantiated signal' field for a _Signal_-type _Event_ must be defined, whereas the 'Called operation' and 'Expression' fields must be empty.




===== Details

An _Event_ is the specification of a specific occurrence at a specific point in space and time.

A _Signal_-type _Event_ is meant to define a _Signal_, and cannot trigger an _Operation_ at the same time.




===== Tips

Add a reference to a _Signal_, if the _Event_ doesn't have one.

An _Event_ referring to an _Operation_ should be a _Call_-type _Event_.
