===== Summary

An _Attribute_ must be typed by a primitive type.




===== Details

An Attribute should always be typed by a primitive type. The type of an attribute must be a so-called "primitive" type.

Primitive types are either:

* UML types (Boolean, string, integer, float etc)
* Enumerations
* _Classes_ or _DataTypes_ as long as they are defined as being "primitive"




===== Tips

When you get a R1480 error, choose one of the following solutions:

* If the current type of the attribute is not the expected one in your design, then consider changing the attribute type for a "primitive" one.
* If it makes sense, consider modifying the typing class or _DataType_ to make it "primitive" (*).
* If you do not wish to make the typing _Class_ or _DataType_ primitive, consider replacing the attribute by an association to the non- primitive typing class or _DataType_.

(*)To make a class or a _DataType_ "primitive", simply select it in the model and set its "primitive" property to true in the element property tab.
