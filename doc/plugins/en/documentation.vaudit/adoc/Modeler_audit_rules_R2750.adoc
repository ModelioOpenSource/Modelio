===== Summary

A transition from a fork or join pseudo state should not have guards or triggers.




===== Details

Fork or Join nodes are decision nodes, therefore transitions leaving from them should not have conditional (such as guard and trigger) properties specified.




===== Tips

Remove any triggers or guards from your transition.
