===== Summary

A _SequenceFlow_ in a _SubProcess_ must have its origin and target in the same _SubProcess_.




===== Details

BPMN _SubProcesses_ represent independent processes. Therefore all the parts of a subprocess sequence must be in that subprocess.




===== Tips

If you have a subprocess sequence that has _SequenceFlows_ coming out of or leading out of the subprocess, you should keep in mind that a subprocess should have a _StartEvent_ and an _EndEvent_, and only one sequence. These rules should ensure that you do not have any coming out of or leading out of the subprocess.
