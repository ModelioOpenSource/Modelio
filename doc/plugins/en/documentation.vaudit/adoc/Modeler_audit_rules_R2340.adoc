===== Summary

of the owner of the _Operation_.




===== Details

An _Operation_ can only redefine an _Operation_ from implemented _Interfaces_ and parent _Classifiers_.




===== Tips

* Remove the redefinition status if it was not intended.
* Implement or inherit the _Classifier_ or _Interface_ that contains the redefined method.
