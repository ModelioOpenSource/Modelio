===== Summary

A primitive _Class_ cannot have _Collaborations_.




===== Details

A _Class_ is primitive (also called elementary) if its value cannot be broken down and its instances are not handled by the application. For example, integer and boolean are elementary Classes, whereas Human or Device are generally not.




===== Tips

If you have a primitive _Class_ with a _Collaboration_ you should consider making the class non-primitive or moving the _Collaboration_ into a non- primitive class.
