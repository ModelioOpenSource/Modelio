===== Summary

The name of a _Classifier's_ _Attributes_ and Roles must be unique in the _Classifier_ and its inherited _Classifiers_.




===== Details

The _Attributes_ and _AssociationEnds_ of a _Classifier_ must have a unique name in that _Classifier_. Furthermore, since when inheriting from a _Classifier_, some of its properties are inherited as well, the name must be unique in the Classifier, but also in all its parents.




===== Tips

If you have several _Attributes_ or _AssociationEnds_ with the same name in a _Classifier_ or its parents, you must rename them so they each have a unique name.
