===== Summary

An _Operation_ must have the same signature as the _Operation_ it redefines.




===== Details

By definition, an operation redefinition overwrites another _Operation_ with the same signature, so you cannot redefine an operation with a different signature than the operation which is doing the redefinition.




===== Tips

Revise your operations' signatures or remove the redefinition.
