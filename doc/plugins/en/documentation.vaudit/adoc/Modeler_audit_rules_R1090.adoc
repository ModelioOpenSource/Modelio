[[Summary]]

===== Summary

A _Classifier_ represented by a sub _ActivityPartition_ must be a nested _Classifier_ or the contained end of a strong composition association of the super _ActivityPartition_'s represented _Classifier_.

===== Details

If a non-external _ActivityPartition_ represents a _Classifier_ and is contained in another _ActivityPartition_, then the containing _ActivityPartition_ must represent a _Classifier_, and the _Classifier_ of the sub _ActivityPartition_ must be nested in the _Classifier_ represented by the containing _ActivityPartition_, or be at the contained end of a strong composition association with the _Classifier_ represented by the containing _ActivityPartition_.

Example:

image::images/Modeler_audit_rules_R1090_modeler_fig_1090.gif[image]

* The "IT *Development*" _ActivityPartition_ is valid because it represents the "*ITDeveloper*" _Classifier_, which is a nested _Classifier_ of the "*ITService*" _Classifier_.
* The "*Development*" _ActivityPartition_ is valid because it represents the "*Developer*" _Classifier_, which is at the end of a strong composition association of the "*ITService*" _Classifier_. Note that any other association would make the rule invalid.
* The "*Management*" _ActivityPartition_ is invalid because it represents the "*RHManager*" _Classifier_, which has nothing to do with the "*ITService*" _Classifier_.

===== Tips

Getting an R1090 error indicates an inconsistency between the organization of the _ActivityPartitions_ and the structure of the _Classifiers_ they represent. The solution usually implies the reorganization of the _ActivityPartitions_ to respect the design expressed by the structure of the represented _Classifiers,_ or the modification of the design of the represented _Classifiers_ so they respect the responsibility scheme expressed by the organization of the _ActivityPartitions_.
