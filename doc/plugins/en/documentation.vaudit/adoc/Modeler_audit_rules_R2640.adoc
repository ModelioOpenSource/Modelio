===== Summary

An _Interface_ cannot have _StateMachines_, except a protocol _StateMachine_.




===== Details

A state machine defines the behavior of an instantiated classifier; therefore it cannot define an interface.

Since an interface specifies conformity characteristics, it does not own detailed behavior specifications. Instead, interfaces may own a protocol state machine that specifies event sequences and pre/post conditions for the operations described by the interface.




===== Tips

* Move the state machine to an instantiable _Classifier_.
* Modify the state machine to define it as a protocol state machine.
