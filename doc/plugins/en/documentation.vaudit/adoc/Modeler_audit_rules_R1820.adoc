===== Summary

A _Gate_ cannot cover a _Lifeline_.




===== Details

A _Gate_ can only belong to an _Interaction_ or an _InteractionUse_.




===== Tips

A _PartDecomposition_, which inherits _InteractionUse_, is represented in a Sequence Diagram by a _Lifeline_. This may be a cause of confusion because the _Lifeline_ will visually be covered by _Gates_ while these _Gates_ really belong to the _PartDecomposition_ that decompose the _Lifeline_.
