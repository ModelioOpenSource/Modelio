===== Summary

_ObjectNodes_ connected by _ObjectFlows_ must have the same upper bounds.




===== Details

_ObjectNodes_ connected by an _ObjectFlow_, with optionally intervening _ControlNodes_, must have the same upper boundaries.




===== Tips

When you get an R1300 warning on an _ObjectFlow_, verify that all upstream and downstream _ObjectNodes_ of this flow have the same upper boundaries. The upper boundaries of an _ObjectNode_ can be changed through the "Element" view when the _ObjectNode_ in question is selected.
