===== Summary

_Message_ and _CommunicationMessage_ cannot have both the "Signal" and "invoked Operation" properties defined.




===== Details

The _Message_ signature can either be a _Signal_ or an _Operation_, but not both at the same time.




===== Tips

If a _Message_ has both _Operation_ and _Signal_ defined, you should consider splitting it into two different Messages instead.
