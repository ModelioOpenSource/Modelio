===== Summary

Multiplicities of an _AssociationEnd_ must be consistent. _MultiplicityMin_ cannot be '*' and _MultiplicityMin_ must be inferior to _MultiplicityMax_.




===== Details

From a logical point of view, it makes sense that a minimum value cannot be higher than a maximum value. Furthermore, if the minimum value is '*' which means infinity, the maximum value cannot possibly be higher.




===== Tips

If you have a minimum multiplicity inferior to the maximum multiplicity or equal to '*', you must change one of these values in order for the minimum multiplicity to be inferior to the maximum multiplicity.
