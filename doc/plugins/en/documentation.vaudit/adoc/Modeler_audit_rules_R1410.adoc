===== Summary

Only one role of an _Association_ can be aggregate or composite.




===== Details

The composition and aggregation concepts illustrate a responsibility role, from the element that owns the _AssociationEnd_ towards the target element. Therefore, this kind of responsibility cannot be both ways, and only one _AssociationEnd_ may be composite or aggregate.




===== Tips

If you have an association with both ends composite or aggregate or a mix of these two, you should change one of its ends or create a second association.
