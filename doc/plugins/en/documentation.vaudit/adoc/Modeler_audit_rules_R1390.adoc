===== Summary

The upper boundary value of the _InputPin_ does not match the maximum multiplicity of the _Attribute_ it represents.




===== Details

_UML constraint_: The type, ordering, and multiplicity of an _InputPin_ must be the same as the corresponding _Attribute_ of the _Signal_.




===== Tips

When you get an R1390 error, verify that the incriminated _Pin_ and _Attribute_ have the same upper boundary and maximum multiplicity value.
