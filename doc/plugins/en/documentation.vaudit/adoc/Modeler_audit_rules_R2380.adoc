===== Summary

An abstract _Operation_ should not redefine a concrete _Operation_.




===== Details

An _Operation_ redefinition corresponds to a different implementation of the method, but abstract methods do not specify implementation, therefore an abstract method should not redefine another method.




===== Tips

* Make this _Operation_ non-abstract.
* Rework the inheritance graph to have abstract _Operations_ on the upper part and concrete _Operations_ on the lower part.
* Disable this rule.
