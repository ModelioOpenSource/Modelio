===== Summary

An _ObjectNode_ ordering property must be set in accordance with the presence of a selection behavior.




===== Details

If an _ObjectNode_ has a selection behaviour, then the ordering of that _ObjectNode_ is "ordered" and vice versa.




===== Tips

When you get an R1350 warning on an _ObjectNode_, verify that the following:

* If the _ObjectNode_ has a selection behaviour, you must set its ordering property to "_ordered"_.
* If the _ObjectNode_ ordering property is set to "_ordered"_, you must set a selection behaviour.
