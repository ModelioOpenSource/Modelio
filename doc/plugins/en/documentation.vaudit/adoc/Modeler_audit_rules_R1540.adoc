===== Summary

A _BindableInstance_'s _RepresentedFeatures_ must not reference themselves, directly or indirectly.




===== Details

For example, if we have three _BindableInstances_ 'A', 'B' and 'C', where 'A' represents 'B', 'B' represents 'C' and 'C' represents 'A', in the end 'A' indirectly represents 'C' and 'C' represents 'A', which is wrong.




===== Tips

Make sure there are no cycles when representing elements in parts and _Ports_.
