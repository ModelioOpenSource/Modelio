===== Tips

When you get a R1030 error, you can fix it by:

* moving one of the ends of the ActivityEdge into an element in the same Activity as the other end
* moving the source of the ActivityEdge into the same Activity as the target or the other way around

You can also use a CallBehaviorAction node to refer to a Behavior (i.e. an Activity, an Interaction or a CommunicationInteraction) from another Activity.
