===== Summary

A _SequenceFlow_ from an _EventBasedGateway_ must target an _IntermediaryCatchEvent_.




===== Details

_Sequenceflows_ from _EventBasedGateways_ are considered as event flows, and can only be caught by an IntermediaryCatchEvent.




===== Tips

If you have sequence flows leaving from an _EventBasedGateway_ that do not target an _IntermediaryCatchEvent_, you should remove these flows.
