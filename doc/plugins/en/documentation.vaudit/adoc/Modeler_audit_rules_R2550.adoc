===== Summary

If a _Port_ is a behavior port, its provided interfaces must be implemented by the _Class_ it belongs to.




===== Details

Any invocation of a behavioral feature on a behavior _Port_ will be handled by the owning _Classifier_ itself, so the _Classifier_ must implement the _Port_ provided _Interfaces_.




===== Tips

* Implement the missing provided interfaces.
* Change the status of the port to make it a classic port, and type it with the classifier that implements the interfaces you need.
