===== Summary

A _SequenceFlow_ cannot have its source or target in different Processes.




===== Details

BPMN Process represent independent flows. Therefore a sequence cannot start in a Process and end in another Process, or have any part of its sequence in another Process.




===== Tips

If you have a sequence that is part of more than one Process, you should consider regrouping the lanes into one Process if you want to represent a unique flow, or use _MessageFlows_ to communicate between the two Processes.
