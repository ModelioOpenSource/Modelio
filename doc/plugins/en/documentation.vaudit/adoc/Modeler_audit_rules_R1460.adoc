===== Summary

A public association oriented from a public Classifier cannot be linked to a private or protected Classifier.




===== Details

Making a public association to a private class usually means that the user of the association won't be able to use it.

Java or C++ code generated from this kind of association will usually result in compilation error.




===== Tips

You can:

* Change the visibility of the association to private. It is widely recommended that all attributes and associations be set to private. 
* Change the visibility of the target class to public.
