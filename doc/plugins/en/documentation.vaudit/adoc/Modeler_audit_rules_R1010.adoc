[[Summary]]

===== Summary

An _ActivityPartition_ cannot be contained in both an _Activity_ and an _ActivityPartition._

[[Details]]

[[details]]
===== Details

The involved _ActivityPartition_ is contained by both another _ActivityPartition_ (through the _SuperPartition_ relationship) and an _Activity_ (through the _InActivity_ relationship), but these relationships should be exclusive of one another.

===== Tips

This rule is usually triggered by a malfunctioning module (or macro). Please contact the module authors so they may fix it.

The problem can be fixed manually by moving the involved _ActivityPartition_ so that it is directly contained by the _Activity_ and then move it back to its place.
