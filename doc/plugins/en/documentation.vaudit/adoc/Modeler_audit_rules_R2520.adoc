===== Summary

If a _Port_ runs a delegation towards an internal part, the _Port_ should provide at least one _Interface_.




===== Details

A delegation is a _Connector_ from a _Port_ and a part of the _Class_ or _Component_ owning the _Port_.

The _Port_ should then provide an interface with a _ProvidedInterface_ in order to have something to delegate.




===== Tips

* Add a provided interface to the port.
* Remove the delegation link.
