===== Summary

All _Operations_ in a _Classifier_ must have a different signature from inherited public and protected operations, except for constructor, destructor and redefined operations.




===== Details

An _Operation_ is identified by its signature, so it must be unique within all the inherited operations in a classifier. Redefined methods are exempt since their job is to actually override another inherited method with the same signature.




===== Tips

* Rename one of the _Operations_ or change its parameters.
* In the Element tab of the redefined _Operation_, specify the _Operation_ it redefines.
