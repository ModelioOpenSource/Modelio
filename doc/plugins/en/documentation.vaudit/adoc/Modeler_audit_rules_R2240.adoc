===== Summary

There can be no inter-package/inter-component dependency cycle.




===== Details

Dependency cycles between _Packages_ and _Components_ should be avoided as these are not good design practice.

For example, a Package P1 depends on another one P2 if one class on P1 derives, imports, or has an association towards a class of P2.




===== Tips

If you have dependency cycles between packages or components, you should review your design.

Use the Impact Diagram of the Analyst module to get a global view of dependencies.
