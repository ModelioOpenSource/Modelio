===== Summary

An «assigned» _Dependency_ must be from an _Actor_, an _Interface_, a _Package_ or a _Process_ towards a _Goal_.




===== Details

An «assigned» _Dependency_ expresses the assigning of a _Goal_ to an owner. This owner is typically an _Actor_, an _Interface_, _Package_ (organizational unit) or _Process_.




===== Tips

If you have assigned a _Goal_ to an element other than an _Actor_, a _Package_ or a _Process_, you should delete your «assigned» _Dependency_.
