===== Summary

A _MessageFlow_ cannot link two elements in the same _Process_.




===== Details

_MessageFlows_ are meant to communicate between two independent processes. They should not be used as a way of communicating within the same Process.




===== Tips

If you have a _MessageFlow_ that has its source and target in the same lane, you should remove it and use sequence flow instead to represent what you need.
