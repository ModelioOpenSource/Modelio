===== Summary

_Attributes_, _Associations_ and _Operations_ cannot simultaneously be _abstract_ and _class_.




===== Details

The '_class_' status of an _Attribute_, _Association_, or _Operation_ makes them static, meaning only one instance can exist at any given time.

The '_abstract_' status, by definition, stipulates that an element cannot be instantiated. The two properties are therefore incompatible and cannot both be true at the same time.




===== Tips

Choose between these two statuses, and set only one of them to true.
