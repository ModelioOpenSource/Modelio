===== Summary

An element cannot have a «usage» _Dependency_ towards itself.




===== Details

A «usage» _Dependency_ means an element uses another element; therefore an element using itself has no sense.




===== Tips

If you have an element that uses itself, you should delete the _Dependency_ or change its destination.
