===== Summary

A _TemplateBinding_ must be created between two elements of the same metaclass or between a _Class_ and a _DataType_.




===== Details

When using a template binding, the linked element must have the same properties in order for it to be compatible.

You cannot for example make a _Package_ instanciate a template _Class_.




===== Tips

Change the source or target of the _TemplateBinding_.
