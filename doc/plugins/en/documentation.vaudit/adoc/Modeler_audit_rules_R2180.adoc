===== Summary

No cycles can exist in a _NameSpace_ inheritance graph.




===== Details

If we have two _NameSpaces_ A and B, and if A inherits from B and B inherits from A, we have an inheritance cycle. Such a cycle is a design error and is strictly forbidden.




===== Tips

Remove one of the links or change its source or destination to break the cycle.
