===== Summary

The ArchiMate element does not appear in any diagram.



===== Details


In ArchiMate, views are central to the organization of the model.
An element that does not appear in any view has probably been forgotten and therefore needs to be unmasked in a view, or it is obsolete and destined to be deleted.
