===== Summary

The relationships to and from a Junction must be of the same kind.




===== Details

Junctions can only connect links of the same kind. +
For example, an "And Junction" with two input Associations can only produce another Association as output. +
Although Modelio will prevent non-compliant relationships to be created to/from a Junction, some may exist in the model following external model import operations.
