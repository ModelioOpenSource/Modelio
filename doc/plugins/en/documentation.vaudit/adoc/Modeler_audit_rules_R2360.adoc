===== Summary

The visibility of an _Operation_ cannot be greater than that of the _Operations_ it redefines.




===== Details

For example, if an operation is protected in its classifier, a classifier that inherits this method can redefine it, but its visibility cannot be public (although it can be private).




===== Tips

* Change the original operation visibility.
* Lower the visibility of the redefining operation.
* Disable the rule.
