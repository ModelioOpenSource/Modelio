===== Summary

In an _Instance_, the type of an instanciated _Attribute_ must be part of the instanciated class or one of its parent classes.




===== Details

The related _Attribute_ of an _AttributeLink_ must be owned by:

* the _Classifier_ typing the _Instance_
* one of the parent Classifiers of the _Classifier_ typing the _Instance_




===== Tips

If you have a slot related to an attribute that is not accessible from the instance's classifier, you should either:

* Change the related attribute to one of the classifier's attributes
* Make the attribute accessible to the classifier, by adding an inheritance link for example
