===== Summary

A _NameSpace_ should not both derive from and import another _NameSpace_.




===== Details

When a _NameSpace_ derives from another _NameSpace_, its entire contents are accessible so there is no need to import it as well.




===== Tips

You can safely remove the import link because it is not necessary.
