===== Summary

All transitions coming into a join vertex must originate from different regions of an orthogonal state.




===== Details

Regions of an orthogonal state are concurrent flows, so a join vertex should only have sources in different regions.




===== Tips

If you have a join vertex with sources in the same region, you should delete one of the transitions or make another region.
