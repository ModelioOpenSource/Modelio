===== Summary

If a _ForkJoinNode_ has an _ObjectFlow_ in its incoming edges, it must have an _ObjectFlow_ in its outgoing edges and vice versa. The same applies for _ControlFlows_.

[[Details]]

===== Details

_UML constraint_:

* The edges coming into and going out of a fork node must be either all _ObjectFlows_ or all _ControlFlows_.
* If a join node has an incoming _ObjectFlow_, it must have an outgoing _ObjectFlow_, otherwise, it must have an outgoing _ControlFlow._

All information entering a _ForkJoinNode_ cannot be lost and all information going out of a ForkJoinNode cannot be created.

===== Tips

When you get an R1250 warning on a _ForkJoinNode_, check the consistency of flows going in and out of the _ForkJoinNode_.
