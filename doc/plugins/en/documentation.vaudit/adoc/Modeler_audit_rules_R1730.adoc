===== Summary

A _Generalization_ must be created between two model elements of the same type, except in the case of a _Signal_, which can specialize a _Signal_ or a _Class_.




===== Details

A _Class_ inheriting from a _UseCase_ or a _Node_ inheriting from an _Artifact_ for example would not make sense.

The only exception is for _Signals_ that can inherit from _Classes_.




===== Tips

* Remove your generalization.
* Change its source or target in order to link two compatible elements.
