===== Summary

A BPMN process should start with a StartEvent and finish with an EndEvent.




===== Details

A BPMN process is represented by a sequence of FlowNodes. A sequence must always start with a StartEvent and end with a EndEvent.




===== Tips

Verify that all FlowNodes are part of a sequence, meaning they have a StartEvent beginning all upstream paths and a EndEvent ending all downstream paths.
