===== Summary

A _BPMN element_ must be part of a _Lane_.




===== Details

When a _BPMN Process_ contains _lanes_, all its _BPMN elements_ (tasks, events...) must be split between these lanes. In this case, the "orphan" element can't be displayed in diagrams.




===== Tips

Select the BPMN element that is not part of any lane and either move it into a lane belonging to the same _BPMN Process_ or delete it.
