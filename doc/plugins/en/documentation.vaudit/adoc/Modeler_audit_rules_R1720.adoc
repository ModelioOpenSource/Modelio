An abstract _NameSpace_ cannot be instantiated. Therefore an abstract _NameSpace_ should not inherit from a _NameSpace_ that can be instantiated because it would inherit instanciable properties.

===== Tips

* Make the child _NameSpace_ concrete.
* Ensure that all parents are abstract.
* You can also consider disabling this rule in the preferences. Many programming languages accept abstract classes inheriting from concrete ones.
