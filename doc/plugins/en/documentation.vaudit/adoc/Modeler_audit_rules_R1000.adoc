===== Summary

An _Abstraction_ must link two different elements. An element cannot be its own _Abstraction_.




===== Details

An _Abstraction_ should always link two different elements. This means that an element cannot be its own abstraction: it cannot abstract itself, since such an auto-abstraction would have no meaning.




===== Tips

Possible solutions to this problem are as follows:

* Change one of the abstraction ends to attach it to another element.
* Remove the incorrect abstraction.
