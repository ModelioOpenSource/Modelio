===== Summary

A _SequenceFlow_ cannot target a _StartEvent_, nor have an _EndEvent_ as its source.




===== Details

A _StartEvent_ begins a sequence and cannot have incoming flows. Similarly, an _EndEvent_ ends a sequence and cannot have any outgoing flows.




===== Tips

If you have incoming flows on a _StartEvent_ or outgoing flows from an EndEvent, you must remove them.
