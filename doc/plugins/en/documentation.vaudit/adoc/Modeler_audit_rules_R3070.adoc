===== Summary

A «derive» _Dependency_ must be from a _UseCase_ or a _Requirement_ towards a _Requirement_.




===== Details

A «derive» _Dependency_ relates a derived _Requirement_ to its source _Requirement_. This typically involves analysis to determine the multiple derived _Requirements_ supported by a source _Requirement_. Derived _Requirements_ generally correspond to _Requirements_ at the next level of the system hierarchy.




===== Tips

If you have a «derive» _Dependency_ which is not from a _UseCase_ or a _Requirement_ toward a _Requirement_, you should delete it.
