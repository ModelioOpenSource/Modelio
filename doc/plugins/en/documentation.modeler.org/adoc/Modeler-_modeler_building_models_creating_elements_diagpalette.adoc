= Creating node-type elements in diagrams

In Modelio diagrams, elements are created using the icons in the palette on the left of the diagram.

All Modelio diagrams include the model expert feature, which provides real-time assistance when you are creating elements in diagrams.

Examples:

.Creating a package in a class in a class diagram – forbidden

If you try to create an unauthorized element (in this example, if you try to create a package *(1)* inside a class), the model expert highlights the concerned element in red *(2)*, indicating that the creation operation you are attempting is not allowed.

.Creating an attribute in a class in a class diagram – allowed

If you try to create an authorized element (in this example, if you try to create an attribute *(3)* inside a class), the model expert highlights the concerned element in green *(4)*, indicating that the creation operation you are attempting is allowed.
