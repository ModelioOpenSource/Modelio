===== Introducing the Modelio macros catalog

Modelio macros are Jython scripts which have been saved as files and which can be accessed via the Modelio interface in the same way as any other command. Macros have a name and can have an associated icon in the Modelio GUI.

The Modelio macros catalog organizes and displays all available macros, and shows the scope of each one, in other words, the level at which it can be run:

* Modelio: The macro is available in all projects in all Modelio workspaces.
* Workspace: The macro is available for all projects in the current Modelio workspace.
* Project: The macro is only available in the current project.
