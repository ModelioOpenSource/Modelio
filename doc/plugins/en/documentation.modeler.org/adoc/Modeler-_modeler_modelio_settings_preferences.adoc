===== Administration

In the *Administration* entry of the *Preferences* dialog, you can define the log level for Modelio and activate the administration commands.

image::images/Modeler-_modeler_modelio_settings_preferences_OpenAdministration.png[5]

*Define the log level for Modelio* By default the log level is set to *Error*, which only logs errors. This option is recommended +
to preserve the application performance and to avoid huge log files to be produced. +
Only in case of problems, should the more verbose levels *Warning, Trace, Debug* be used.

*activate the 'Administration' commands* These commands are available in the model root's context menu:

* *Deploy a module directly from a jmdac file...*: lets you deploy a module in the current project from the jmdac archive of the module. The deployed module will be stored in the modules catalog.
* *Defragment local model*: Impact links and various local data are stored in the 'local model'. As the model is being regularly saved, the local model fragments increasingly, occupying more and more disc space, and increasing the backup time. Defregmenting the local model will release disc space and reduce backup time.
* *Rebuild indexes*: Model indexes are used by Modelio to quickly search the model for elements. Rebuilding the indexes can fix '_shell_' elements. After the indexes have been rebuilt, the project needs to be closed and reopened for new indexes to be taken into account.
* *Defragment indexes*: The size of the indexes increases every time the model is saved. Indexes use more and more disc space and backup time. Defragmenting the indexes helps releasing disc space and reduce projects backup time.
* *Rebuild all impact models*: It may happen that SVN operations corrupt the impact model. This command rebuilds the whole imact model.





===== Module catalog

The Modelio modules catalog is the list of all modules which are known to your local Modelio installation. By default, the modules that appear in the modules catalog are those provided with your Modelio installation, but you can also add other modules which you have downloaded or created yourself, for subsequent use in your Modelio projects.

image::images/Modeler-_modeler_modelio_settings_preferences_OpenModule_catalog.png[6]

Upon opening the Modules catalog, the following options are activated by default:

* *Show only latest versions* : Several versions of a single module may coexist in the catalog. With this option on, only the latest version is displayed.
* *Show only compatibleversions* : Only modules which are compatible with the currrent version of Modelio are displayed.

By default, the modules catalog is located in the user folder:

* Linux / Mac OSX: `${HOME}/.modelio/4.1/modules`
* Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.modelio\4.1\modules`

You can relocate Modelio's modules catalog. To do so, simply click on the 'Move modules catalog...' button and select a new location. The catalog contents will be moved to the chosen directory. Please note that this process may take a few minutes, depending on the catalog size and the machine's capacities.





===== Network configuration

This section lets you configure the connection to a proxy server.

* HTTP : 80
* SSL : 443
* SOCKS : 1080
