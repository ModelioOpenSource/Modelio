The XMI profile export window

*Keys:*

1. In this field, select the path of the file (which may or may not already exist) to which you want to export.
2. When the "Adding Modelio annotations" option has been activated, more information will be exported, ensuring maximum compatibility in the case of a re-import into Modelio. Some information available in Modelio but not present in UML2 can be retrieved in this way.
3. In the "Compatibility" field, select a format for the export. Choose between UML2.1.1, UML2.2, UML2.3, UML2.4.1 and EMF210.
4. In the "Extension" field, define the extension that will be assigned to the file you are going to export (either ".xmi" ou ".uml").
5. The progress bar shows the progress of the export operation
