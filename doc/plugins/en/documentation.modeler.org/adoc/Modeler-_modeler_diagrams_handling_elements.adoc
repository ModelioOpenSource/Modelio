===== Selecting a diagram element in the "Model" view

When working in a diagram, you may want to be able to jump to a specific element in the "Model" view, without having to manually select it.

To do this, just right-click on the element in the diagram to open the context menu, and run the "Select in explorer" command. You can also use the "*Ctrl+Enter*" shortcut. This automatically activates the "Model" view with the element in question selected.

*Note:* This function is only available on box elements.

If you want to move an element to a different position, just select it, hold down the left mouse button and move it to the desired location. You can see the position of the object while it is being moved.

If the element has any links (associations, generalizations, ...), these links graphically "follow" the element when it is moved.

[[moving-an-element-to-a-different-owner-element]]
===== Moving an element to a different owner element

Using the drag and drop feature, you can move an element from one parent element to another. For example, you can move a class from one package into another package.

To do this, just select the element you want to move and drag it into the new parent element. When this type of operation is carried out, the "Model" view is automatically updated and model consistency maintained. If the new parent is an unauthorized element, it will be highlighted in red. If it is authorized, then it is highlighted in green.

In both cases, the "Model" view is automatically updated and model consistency maintained.
