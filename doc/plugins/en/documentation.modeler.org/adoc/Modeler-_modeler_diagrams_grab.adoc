= Using the grab function

The "Grab" function is used to move the entire contents of a diagram, without having to select each element.

To use the "Grab" function, simply carry out the following steps:

* Click inside the diagram whose contents you want to grab and move.
* Hold down the mouse wheel button until you see the small image:images/Modeler-_modeler_diagrams_grab_grab_hand.png[2] hand icon appear.
* Still holding down the right mouse button, drag the image:images/Modeler-_modeler_diagrams_grab_grab_hand.png[2] hand within the graphic editor. The entire contents of the diagram are then moved to wherever you move the mouse.
