The drag and drop feature enables you to quickly unmask elements in Modelio diagrams by just dragging them from the "Model" view into a diagram, as shown in the example below.

1.  Left-click on the element in the "Model" view.
2.  Drag the element into the diagram and release the mouse button.

*Note:* You can simultaneously drag and drop several elements into a diagram by just holding down the "*Ctrl*" key, selecting all the elements in question in the "Model" view, and then dragging and dropping them all into the diagram.
