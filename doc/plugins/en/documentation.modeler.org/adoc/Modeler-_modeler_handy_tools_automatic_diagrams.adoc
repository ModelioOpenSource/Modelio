= Automatic diagrams




== Concept

Automatic diagram generation is an extremely useful function, notably when massive code reverse operations are run, during which existing code is transformed into a model in order to analyze its design or documentation production.

The general problem with automatic diagram generation is "which elements to show, and how to present them?". There is no general answer to this question. Modelio proposes a pragmatic approach, through a limited number of generated diagram types, whose contents and presentation are precisely defined, and whose usefulness and use can be predicted.

The automatic diagrams proposed by Modelio fit into the context of using Modelio for development tasks, with automatic diagrams focused on packages and classes.




== Automatic diagrams proposed

Currently, Modelio produces the following automatic diagrams:

* <<Modeler-_modeler_handy_tools_automatic_diagrams_Inheritance_diagram.adoc#,Inheritance diagram>>
* <<Modeler-_modeler_handy_tools_automatic_diagrams_Class_structure_diagram.adoc#,Class structure diagram>>
* <<Modeler-_modeler_handy_tools_automatic_diagrams_Package_structure_diagram.adoc#,Package structure diagram>>
