===== Imported elements

Elements that can be imported into your project are presented in a standard hierarchy (packages containing classes). To view the classes contained in an importable package, simply click on the "+" on the left of the package name.

The following list describes exactly what is imported for each type of element.

* Project : The entire project (packages, classes, ...)
* Package : Classes (with their operations, attributes, "visible" associations), documents, tagged values, diagrams
* Class : Operations, attributes, "visible" associations, documents, tagged values, diagrams

Non-imported objects are:

* Reference links from a package to another element that is not imported and that does not already exist in the current project
* Non-oriented associations (no visibility on either side)

The import will fail if there is any inconsistency between imported elements.
